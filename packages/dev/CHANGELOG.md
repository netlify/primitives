### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* The `BlobsServer` class now only exports the `start()` and `stop()` methods. This class is not part of the Netlify Blobs client, and it's mostly used internally by Netlify tooling and by some users for integration tests — if you're just using the methods listed in https://docs.netlify.com/blobs/overview/#api-reference, this change does not apply to you and you can safely upgrade.

### Features

* add `start` entry point ([#154](https://github.com/netlify/primitives/issues/154)) ([b23c607](https://github.com/netlify/primitives/commit/b23c607ed3aa5e76279efa773b8c6c4d0dee972c))
