# Netlify Primitives

A monorepo containing the runtime and local development components of different Netlify platform primitives.

## Local development

This monorepo uses [npm workspaces](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/workspaces/).

Start by installing the dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

You can then build all the packages:

```sh
npm run build -ws
```
